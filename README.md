# This repository is a template for bot creation with [Microsoft's Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/).

<br>

Microsoft's Bot Framework helps you create chat bots and connect them to popular chat platforms such as SMS, Email, Skype, Slack, etc.

But the [Official Bot Framework Documentation](https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/) is vague. Such vagueness resulted in days of troubleshooting for me.

This template will save you from wasting time.
